I finish the first part of this practice, I created it with the help of my professor in Diplomado Software Development. I learn how to recreate
a Twitter appearance, I learnt html and CSS coding. We took the mockup from Figma:

As I worked alone in the building of index.html style, I think I could organize better css stylesheet by dividing each style in individual files.
